Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

Ans- Semantic tags in HTML are elements that convey meaning and provide context to the content within them. These tags describe the type of content they contain, rather than just specifying how the content should be presented. Semantic tags were introduced in HTML5 to improve the structure and semantics of web documents.

Here are some examples of semantic tags:

<header>: Represents the introductory content of a page or section.
<nav>: Defines a section that contains navigation links.
<main>: Represents the main content of the document.
<article>: Defines a self-contained, independent piece of content.
<section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the surrounding content.
<footer>: Defines the footer of a page or section.
The use of semantic tags brings several benefits:

Improved accessibility: Semantic tags make it easier for assistive technologies (such as screen readers) to understand and navigate the content, improving accessibility for users with disabilities.

Search engine optimization (SEO): Search engines rely on the structure and semantics of web pages to understand and index their content. By using semantic tags, you provide clearer signals to search engines about the meaning and importance of different sections of your page, potentially improving your search rankings.

Readability and maintainability: Semantic tags improve the readability of your HTML code by providing a clearer structure. They also make it easier to maintain and update your code, as the purpose of each section is more explicit.

Future-proofing: Semantic tags are designed to be forward-compatible, meaning they can accommodate new features and elements that may be introduced in future versions of HTML. This helps ensure that your code remains valid and future-proof.
