Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

Ans-HTML tags and elements are closely related but have distinct meanings.

HTML Tags:
- HTML tags are the markup elements used to define the structure and formatting of content within an HTML document.
- They are represented by angled brackets (`<` and `>`) surrounding a tag name. For example, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<h1>`, etc.
- Tags are used to enclose content and provide instructions to web browsers on how to render that content.
- HTML tags can have attributes that provide additional information or modify the behavior of the tag.
- Tags can be opening tags (`<tag>`) or closing tags (`</tag>`). Some tags are self-closing, meaning they don't require a separate closing tag.

HTML Elements:
- HTML elements are comprised of tags along with the content enclosed between the opening and closing tags.
- An HTML element consists of a start tag, the content, and an end tag (in most cases).
- For example, the `<p>` element consists of an opening tag `<p>`, the content (text, images, other elements), and a closing tag `</p>`.
- Elements are the building blocks of an HTML document, representing different parts and sections of the content.
- HTML elements can be nested within each other, forming a hierarchical structure.
