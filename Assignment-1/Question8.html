Q.8 What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?

Ans- <img> tag:
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML document. It is a self-closing tag and requires the src attribute, which specifies the source URL of the image file. The <img> tag is primarily used to display standalone images within the content of a webpage.

<figure> tag:
The <figure> tag represents self-contained content that is referenced from the main content. It is typically used to group media elements (such as images, illustrations, diagrams, videos, etc.) along with their captions or descriptions. The purpose of the <figure> element is to provide semantic meaning and structure to this group of content.
