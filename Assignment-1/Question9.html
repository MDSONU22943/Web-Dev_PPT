Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

Ans-In HTML, tags and attributes serve different purposes.

1. HTML Tags:
   HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of an HTML document. They are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and consist of an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag identifies the beginning of an element, and the closing tag identifies the end of that element.

   For example:
   ```html
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   ```
   In the above example, the `<p>` tag represents a paragraph element. The opening tag `<p>` indicates the start of the paragraph, and the closing tag `</p>` indicates the end of the paragraph.

2. HTML Attributes:
   HTML attributes provide additional information about an element. They are used within the opening tag of an HTML element and are specified as name-value pairs. Attributes provide characteristics or properties to the elements and define their behavior, appearance, or functionality.

   For example:
   ```html
   <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image Description">
   ```
   In the above example, the `src` and `alt` attributes are used with the `<img>` tag. The `src` attribute specifies the source (URL or file path) of the image, while the `alt` attribute provides alternative text that is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.

Global Attributes:
HTML also includes a set of global attributes that can be used with any HTML element. These attributes can be used to enhance the behavior or appearance of elements universally. Some examples of global attributes are:

1. `class`: Specifies one or more CSS classes to be associated with an element.
2. `id`: Specifies a unique identifier for an element.
3. `style`: Specifies inline CSS styles for an element.
4. `title`: Specifies additional information about an element (tooltip text).
5. `lang`: Specifies the language of the element's content.
6. `data-*`: Allows custom data attributes to be added to elements.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of some global attributes:
```html
<div class="container" id="myContainer" style="background-color: #f1f1f1;" lang="en">
  <p title="This is a paragraph">Hello, world!</p>
</div>
```
