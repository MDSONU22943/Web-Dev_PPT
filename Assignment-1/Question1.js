/*
 Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?

Ans- No, <!DOCTYPE html>` is not a tag in HTML. It is called a document type declaration or doctype declaration. 

The <!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is used at the very beginning of an HTML document to specify the version of HTML being used. In this case, it indicates that the document is written in HTML5, which is the latest version of HTML.

The purpose of the doctype declaration is to inform the web browser about the rules and syntax that should be used to parse the HTML document. It helps the browser understand how to interpret and render the content correctly. Different versions of HTML have different rules and features, so specifying the doctype is important for ensuring consistent rendering across different browsers.

By using <!DOCTYPE html>`, you are telling the browser to use the HTML5 standard, which is widely supported by modern web browsers. It also ensures that your document will be rendered in standards mode, which helps avoid compatibility issues and ensures better consistency in how the web page is displayed.
