Q.4 Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?
ANs-In HTML, there are three display properties that define how elements are rendered within a document: inline, inline-block, and block. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

1. Inline:
   - Inline elements do not start on a new line and do not force subsequent elements to start on a new line.
   - They only take up as much width as necessary to contain their content.
   - Examples of inline elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, etc.
   - They cannot have a fixed width or height, and margin and padding values only affect the left and right sides, not the top and bottom.

2. Inline-block:
   - Inline-block elements share some characteristics with both inline and block elements.
   - They flow within the text like inline elements but also respect width, height, margin, and padding values like block elements.
   - They start on the same line as other inline elements but can have specified width and height values.
   - Examples of inline-block elements include `<img>`, `<input>`, and `<button>`.

3. Block:
   - Block elements start on a new line and create a block-level box.
   - They take up the entire width available by default and force subsequent elements to start on a new line.
   - Block elements can have specified width, height, margins, and padding values.
   - Examples of block elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.
