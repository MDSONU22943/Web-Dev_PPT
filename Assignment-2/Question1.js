Q.1 Whatâ€™s Box Model in CSS ? 
Ans- The box model in CSS is a fundamental concept that describes how elements on a web page are rendered and displayed. It defines the structure and layout of an element by organizing its content into several layers or boxes. These boxes include the content area, padding, border, and margin.

Here's a breakdown of each component of the box model:

1. Content Area: It represents the actual content of an element, such as text, images, or other HTML elements. The width and height of the content area can be specified using CSS properties.

2. Padding: It is a transparent area around the content, separating it from the element's border. Padding provides space between the content and the border. The padding can be set using the CSS `padding` property.

3. Border: It is a line that surrounds the content and padding of an element. Borders can be styled and have properties like color, width, and style. The border can be set using the CSS `border` property.

4. Margin: It is a transparent area outside the element's border, creating space between adjacent elements. Margins do not have a background or border. The margin can be set using the CSS `margin` property.

The dimensions of an element on a web page are calculated by summing the content area, padding, border, and margin. The total width of an element can be calculated as follows:

Total width = Content width + Padding + Border + Margin

Understanding the box model is crucial for proper layout and positioning of elements on a web page. It allows developers to control the spacing, borders, and overall structure of the content within an element.
