Q.3 What is VW/VH ?
Ans- In HTML, VW and VH are units of measurement used for specifying sizes relative to the viewport. Here's what they mean:

VW (Viewport Width): It represents a percentage of the width of the viewport. For example, 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport's width. If the viewport is 1000 pixels wide, 1vw would be equal to 10 pixels.

VH (Viewport Height): Similar to VW, VH represents a percentage of the height of the viewport. For instance, 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport's height. If the viewport is 800 pixels tall, 1vh would be equal to 8 pixels.
